They mentioned that this is not a high priority project and they will meet with the board or committee for brain injury rehabilitation in NSW (Australia) and discuss if they need a tool to streamline this process. They also said that they will not be willing to use the tool I made, however they will refer to the website and the video of how the tool works to convince the brain injury rehabilitation board or committee the need for such a tool. If the board/committee agrees, they will open the project for bidding to everyone and give me an opportunity to bid for this project. </a></td>
